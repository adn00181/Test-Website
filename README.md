  <h1>Welcome to Adam's Page</h1>
  <p>This is a basic example of an HTML page structure.</p>
  <p class="indented">Here is a section of additional content I wanted to add to this page There are 538 votes in the Electoral College and it takes a majority — 270 — to win. In most states, it's a winner-take-all system — whichever candidate comes out ahead, no matter how slim the margin, gets all of the state's Electoral College votes. Only two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split.

<p>I'm putting this text to the right to make room for a picture. The race between Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris will likely come down to a handful of battleground states where voters are closely divided. <p>
<div class="right-half">
</div>    
  <p>This text is aligned to the right side of the page but only within the right half.</p>
